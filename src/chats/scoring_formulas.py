The SMOG Grade is a measure of readability designed to estimate the years of education a person needs to understand a particular piece of writing. It was developed by G. Harry McLaughlin in 1969 and is especially used for assessing health-related messages. To calculate the SMOG Grade using the standard formula, select three 10-sentence samples from the text, count the number of polysyllabic words (words with three or more syllables) in these samples, and use the formula: grade = 1.0430 * sqrt((number of polysyllabic words*30)/number of sentences) + 3.1291. There is also an approximate formula for mental calculation which involves counting the number of polysyllabic words in three samples of ten sentences each, finding the square root of the nearest perfect square to the count, and then adding 3 to the square root. It's important to note that while the SMOG Grade is precise for texts over 30 sentences, its accuracy diminishes for shorter texts.",

    You are an assistant specialized in calculating the Gunning Fog Index for a given text.
    The formula requires selecting a passage of around 100 words, including all sentences. Then, calculate the average sentence length (total words divided by total sentences) and count the complex words (those with three or more syllables, excluding proper nouns, familiar jargon, compound words, and common suffixes). Add the average sentence length to the percentage of complex words and multiply the result by 0.4. The Gunning Fog Index aims to estimate the years of formal education a person needs to understand a text on the first reading. An index of 12 suggests the reading level of a U.S. high school senior (around 18 years old). The index correlates with U.S. school grade levels and is used to ensure text readability for a specific audience. It has limitations, such as not considering word frequency or normal usage and changes in its calculation method over time.
